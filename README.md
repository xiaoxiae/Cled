The <strong>cli</strong>mber's <strong>ed</strong>itor – a 3D editor designed for efficient virtual routesetting.

This repository contains the source code to the Cled editor, along with various scripts used to import assets used from [Clis](https://github.com/xiaoxiae/Clis/), released under the GPLv3 license.

## Running Cled
First, download the lastest version from the [Releases page](https://github.com/xiaoxiae/Cled/releases).

To use Cled, you need a wall and holds dataset.
A dataset example, along with the specification, can be found in `Models/Example`.
This dataset can then be imported to Cled either by `File > New`, or by pressing `Ctrl+N`.

To generate your own dataset, use [Clis](https://github.com/xiaoxiae/Clis/) to generate the hold and wall models and then use `Scripts/ClisImporter.py` to prepare them for usage.
Note that you will likely need to install a number of Python packages -- to do this, you can follow the [Clis README](https://github.com/xiaoxiae/Clis/) on the \verb|Scripts/requirement.txt| file (see appendix \ref{apx:clissetup}).

For additional information, see the [thesis](https://github.com/xiaoxiae/Thesis).
